Notes: 
Imperative vs Declarative Programming
Imperative programming is how you do something (Descriptive), and declarative programming is more like what you do. 
Declarative Programming - we usually mutate a piece of state
Functional programming is a subset of declarative programming.
Declarative programming is “the act of programming in languages that conform to the mental model of the developer rather than the operational model of the machine.”
In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
